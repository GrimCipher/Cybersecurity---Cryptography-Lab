 the cybersecurity breach that occurred at Equifax in 2017. This breach stands as one of the most significant cybersecurity incidents in recent history.
 Equifax, one of the largest credit reporting agencies globally, suffered a breach that exposed the sensitive personal information of over 147 million individuals.
The breach occurred due to a vulnerability in the Apache Struts web application framework,specifically in the Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638 vulnerability, 
which allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely.

Motivations behind the breach primarily revolved around financial gain and data exploitation.
The stolen information included names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and in some cases, driver's license numbers.
With such valuable data in hand, cybercriminals could engage in identity theft, financial fraud, and other illicit activities for profit.
The extensive scale and sensitivity of the exposed data amplified the severity of the breach,
resulting in significant repercussions for Equifax and affected individuals.

The breach highlighted critical tech flaws in Equifax's cybersecurity infrastructure, particularly regarding patch management and vulnerability remediation.
Equifax failed to promptly apply available security patches for the Apache Struts vulnerability, despite patches being released well in advance of the breach. 
This oversight allowed attackers to exploit the vulnerability and gain unauthorized access to Equifax's systems.
 Since the breach, Equifax has implemented stricter patch management policies, enhanced network segmentation,
 and invested in advanced threat detection and response capabilities to fortify its defenses against similar vulnerabilities and attacks in the future.
